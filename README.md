# Build Your Own Agent - Workshop

## Overview
The world is changing fast as AI agentic systems evolve around us, transforming how we work and build software. They assist us not only in writing code but also in powering personal productivity tools, managing emails and calendars, and running automated trading systems. They even generate Tosca test cases.

*But how does an agent actually work, and what does it do behind the scenes?*

In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to program your own AI agent from scratch — without relying on third‑party AI libraries or SDKs. By building it incrementally, you’ll gain a deep understanding of how these systems operate and how to design them yourself.

## What You'll Learn

- Understand the foundational concepts behind AI agentic systems
- Apply modern software engineering practices to build an agent using test‑driven development 
- Interact with a Chat API (e.g., OpenAI’s API) to enable conversational capabilities
- Use integration tests to manage and validate interactions with the infrastructure layer
- Learn how the Agent Loop operates and how to implement it incrementally

## Schedule
This is a half-day workshop. It takes 4 hours.

## Who is This For
This workshop is ideal for developers, engineers, and AI enthusiasts who want a deeper technical understanding of agent design and modern software engineering practices.

## What to Bring

- A development environment of your choice (programming language does not matter)
- A project with a failing unit test and a library for mocking web requests 
  For example:
    - C# with NUnit and WireMockNet
    - Java with JUnit and WireMock
    - JavaScript or TypeScript with Jest and mswjs
    - Python with pytest and request-mock
    or another language and http mocking tool of your choice
